## What is Software Engineering?

Application of scientific principles to the design and creation of software.

## Software Engineers

Software Engineers are not just software developers

- Software Engineers apply their knowledge to build entire systems and their structure, while developers write code to solve specific problems.
- Software Engineers have a big picture vision of the whole system at a time.
- Software Engineers have [Project Management](../../../google-project-management-certificate/index.md) skills.

## Process of Software Engineering

> Design <br />
  How will communication be made? What services will exist? Streamline entities.
> Build (and test) <br />
  Can other people read your code? Is your code's intent clear? Is it easy to add new features?
> Mantain <br />
  Check application logs, scale when needed, performance.

Software Engineers are also tasked with consulting with stakeholders about problems they might encounter.
